# Devops-test
*Write a Dockerfile to run nginx version 1.19 in a container. Choose a base image, considering security best practices, and aim for the image to pass a container image security test

*Write a Kubernetes StatefulSet to deploy the nginx container from the previous question. Utilize persistent volume claims and define resource limits for optimal performance.

*Set up a streamlined build and deployment pipeline for the nginx application using GitHub Actions or an equivalent CI/CD tool. Ensure the pipeline covers building the Docker image, running security checks, and deploying to a Kubernetes cluster.
